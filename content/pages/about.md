Welcome to my website!

I'm starting this website (and blog) to showcase projects and, more importantly, talk about what I'm learning and what excites me. Iâ€™m hoping this motivates me to write more, and with time get better at writing too.

The contents of this blog reflect my personal opinions only. I write the posts in my free time, and I never write on behalf of my employer in this blog. As a policy, it doesn't contain paid writing assignments. Credit to <a href = "https://eli.thegreenplace.net/pages/about" target="_blank">Eli Blendersky's about page</a> for this disclaimer paragraph.
