Welcome to my website!

I'm starting this website (and blog) to showcase projects and, more importantly, talk about what I'm learning and what excites me. 
Iâ€™m hoping this motivates me to write more, and with time get better at writing too.

The contents of this blog reflect my personal opinions only. 
I write the posts in my free time, and I never write on behalf of my employer in this blog. 
As a policy, it doesn't contain paid writing assignments.

## Contact
If you have any questions, concerns, comments for me, please feel free to [send me an email (taadith@gmail.com)](mailto:taadith@gmail.com). 
This includes dissenting/concurring from any of my blog posts!
