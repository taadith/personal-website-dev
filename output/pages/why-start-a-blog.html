            <h1>why start a blog?</h1>
            
            <p>Creating a blog has been an interest of mine for the past 10 years. I was introduced to Blogger, a popular blogging website in the 2000s, through a random middle school English elective class. The blogging<sup id="fnref:footnote1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnote1">1</a></sup> in question consisted of answering writing prompts with blog posts. I thoroughly enjoyed the process of brainstorming, drafting, writing, and editing<sup id="fnref:footnote2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnote2">2</a></sup>. At the same time, I didn’t have the freedom to take my time on each blog post, because it was an assignment. I couldn’t fully appreciate it for what it was because it was “just for a grade” and my initial exposure to blogging. So, after this brief stint, I hung up my “blogging boots”.</p>
<p>Throughout the rest of my secondary schooling, my writing purely came from assignments. I had forgotten my time in “Bloggerland “ and began to get annoyed with how writing was simply an end to a means<sup id="fnref2:footnote2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnote2">2</a></sup>. I had to write to do well in school, and before I could think about how I felt about what I had written, the next assignment came along. I couldn’t take the time to dissect what I had written, let alone figure out how I could have written with a better depth of analysis. </p>
<p>Even through college, these friction points continued to bug me. My free time had completely evaporated. I couldn’t find the time to revisit blogging, let alone know what to write about or if I could even consider myself an <em>expert</em> that could write informatively on a topic. So blogging continued to be put on hold.</p>
<p>In the last two years, I began to stumble upon blogs discussing topics such as programming language design, system design, computability theory, number theory, writing effectiveness, African philosophy, gender theory…<sup id="fnref:footnote4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnote4">4</a></sup> I could write a whole blog post on what I was reading and have been continuing to read. This began to push me to see the reality of writing blog posts and more importantly… how it could be about <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>I graduated from college a year ago, with my bachelor degree in computer science and a minor in philosophy<sup id="fnref2:footnote4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnote4">4</a></sup>, and have been working a corporate job for six months now. Finding myself in the early throes of decades-long corporate churning and burnout, I starting thinking of ways to make something out of my free time that I could claim as totally mine and truly <em>fun</em>. Trying to think of what I could make out of my free time led me back to my memories of using Blogger, my desire to write, and the incredibly informative blogs I kept stumbling upon. By now, I had made up my mind, I had to write a blog!</p>
<p>I could always just create a blog using Wix or Wordpress, but what’s the fun in that? Of course, creating a blog could be done the <em>easy</em> way, with Wix or Wordpress. I could have simply used Wix or Wordpress, but I wanted to create this website from scratch<sup id="fnref:footnote5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnote5">5</a></sup>. I'm not a great front-end<sup id="fnref:footnote6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnote6">6</a></sup> developer, so I chose to use Pelican, a static site generator made in Python. This drastically reduced the potential man-hours it would have taken to write up the HTML and CSS from scratch.</p>
<p>Of course, I could use a cloud platform to host the website, but I wouldn’t get the fun of creating a website from scratch. I had messed around with a Raspberry Pi a few years ago and had found blogs about how you could host a website from one. So, I thought “That can’t be too hard to do, if someone else has done it!” I bought a Raspberry Pi, booted it up with Raspberry Pi OS, a flavor of Debian which is a flavor of Linux<sup id="fnref:footnote7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnote7">7</a></sup>, and then installed an open-source HTTP web server called nginx. After some quick configuration, my website was up and running<sup id="fnref:footnote8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnote8">8</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>what's in a name?</h2>
<p>So why is it called "sisyphean didactic auto-flagellator"? As I went through college, I found myself enraptured by the numerous subfields of mathematics and computer science classes I could take: algorithms, data structures, quantum algorithms, machine learning, computability theory, linear algebra<sup id="fnref:footnote9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnote9">9</a></sup>, calculus, topology... Honestly, the list just goes on and on.
I began to realize that I had this infectious passion for learning that I just can't get rid of even if it were to drive me mad, or even to death[^footnote10].</p>
<p>I searched up a phrase for a person who likes to torture themselves by 
learning and I found something quite close: 
<strong>sisyphean didactic auto-flagellator</strong><sup id="fnref2:footnote6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnote6">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I have left out a lot that was involved in getting this website up and running. Dynamic DNS (DDNS) was really difficult to figure out, and I’m embarrassed to say that I resorted to Claude AI to help me with some of the steps… But with Claude’s help, I was able to get a SSL certificate for free and make my website use the HTTPS protocol! I may write a future blog post about this if there’s enough interest.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:footnote8" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
