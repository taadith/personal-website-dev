        <p>Creating a blog has been an interest of mine for the past 10 years. 
I was introduced to Blogger, a popular blogging website in the 2000s, through a random middle school English elective class. 
The blogging<sup id="fnref:lost Blogger account"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:lost Blogger account">1</a></sup> in question consisted of answering writing prompts with blog posts. 
I thoroughly enjoyed the process of brainstorming, drafting, writing, and editing<sup id="fnref:writing process"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:writing process">2</a></sup>. 
At the same time, I didn’t have the freedom to take my time on each blog post because it was an assignment. 
I couldn’t fully appreciate it for what it was because it was “just for a grade” and my initial exposure to blogging. 
So, after this brief stint, I hung up my “blogging boots”.</p>
<p>Throughout the rest of my secondary schooling, my writing was purely assignment based. 
I had forgotten my time in “Bloggerland “ and began to get annoyed with how writing was simply a means to an end<sup id="fnref:philosophy"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:philosophy">3</a></sup>. 
I had to write to do well in school, and before I could think about how I felt about what I had written, the next assignment would come along. 
I couldn’t take the time to dissect what I had written, let alone figure out how I could have written with a better depth of analysis. </p>
<p>Even through college, these friction points continued to bug me. 
My free time had completely evaporated. I couldn’t find the time to revisit blogging, let alone figure out what to write about or if I could even consider myself an <em>expert</em> able to write informatively on a topic. 
So blogging remained on hold.</p>
<p>In the last two years, I began to stumble upon blogs discussing topics such as programming language design, system design, computability theory, number theory, effective writing, African philosophy, gender theory… I could write a whole blog post on what I was reading and have been continuing to read. This began to push me to see the reality of writing blog posts and more importantly… how it could be about <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>I graduated from college a year ago with my bachelor's degree in computer science and a minor in philosophy<sup id="fnref:bragging"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bragging">4</a></sup>, and have been working a corporate job for the past six months. In the early throes of decades-long corporate churning and burnout, I began thinking of ways to make something out of my free time that was totally mine and truly <em>fun</em>. This led me back to my memories of using Blogger, my desire to write, and the incredibly informative blogs I had stumbled upon. By now, I had made up my mind, I had to write a blog!</p>
<p>I could have simply used Wix or WordPress, but I wanted to create this website from scratch<sup id="fnref:blog purpose"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:blog purpose">5</a></sup>. I'm not a great front-end[^footnote6] developer, so I chose to use Pelican, a static site generator made in Python.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A front-end developer works on what the user sees and interacts with. 
More specifically, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files related to the web application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This drastically reduced the potential man-hours it would have taken to write up the HTML and CSS from scratch. However, I no longer have bragging rights to being a <em>fully</em> full-stack developer.</p>
<p>I could use a cloud platform to host the website, but I wouldn’t get the fun of creating a website from scratch. I had messed around with a Raspberry Pi a few years ago and had found blogs about how you could host a website from one. So, I thought “That can’t be too hard to do if someone else has done it!” I bought a Raspberry Pi, booted it up with Raspberry Pi OS, a flavor of Debian which is a flavor of Linux<sup id="fnref:missing link"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:missing link">6</a></sup>, and then installed an open-source HTTP web server called nginx. After some quick configuration, my website was up and running.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I left out a lot of the work involved in getting this website up and running. 
Dynamic DNS (DDNS) was really difficult to figure out, and I’m embarrassed to say that I resorted to Claude AI to help me with some of the steps… 
But with Claude’s help, I was able to get an SSL certificate for free and make my website use the HTTPS protocol! 
I may write a future blog post about this if there’s enough interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>what's in a name?</h2>
<p>So why is it called "sisyphean didactic auto-flagellator"? As I went through college, I found myself enraptured by the numerous subfields of mathematics and computer science classes I could take: algorithms, data structures, quantum algorithms, machine learning, computability theory, linear algebra<sup id="fnref:lin alg"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:lin alg">7</a></sup>, calculus, topology... Honestly, the list just goes on and on.
I began to realize that I had this infectious passion for learning that I just can't get rid of even if it were to drive me mad, or even to death<sup id="fnref:curious cat"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:curious cat">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I searched up a phrase for a person who likes to torture themselves by 
learning and I found something quite close: 
<strong>sisyphean didactic auto-flagellator</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Funnily enough, I actually found the phrase “sisyphean didactic auto-flagellator” from an <strong><em><a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/64541/word-for-a-person-who-likes-to-torture-himself-by-learning-something-difficult/" target="_blank">English Stack Exchange Question</a></em></strong>.</p>
