        <p>If you're my weekly 1-3 visitors<sup id="fnref:weekly users"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:weekly users">1</a></sup>, you may have noticed the website went down… 
It seems that when you host a website using 
<strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS" target="_blank">DDNS</a></em></strong> (dynamic <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" target="”_blank”">DNS</a></em></strong>) on your home WiFi, your ISP (internet service provider) may not be a huge fan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accessing a website is tantamount to accessing files hosted by or on a computer, often called a server, through the Internet.
The way our computer, often called the client, can talk to the server is through the use of an IP (Internet Protocol) address, the Internet version of a mailing address.
It would be a pain if you had to remember the IP address for every website you want to use on a daily basis.
Thankfully, we don’t have to memorize every website’s IP address because of DNS (domain name system).
DNS allows you to use a human-friendly domain name, or URL, instead of the computer's IP address.
Then, DNS servers will help find the IP address related to the website you’re seeking and provide it to your computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previously, when I had my website’s related files on my <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi" target="”_blank”">Raspberry Pi</a></em></strong>, I used DDNS with the help of a company <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-IP" target="”_blank”">No-IP</a></em></strong>​​.
No-IP’s DDNS application would run every 5-10 minutes on my Raspberry Pi telling No-IP’s servers if my external IP address had changed.
If it did change, they would make sure to publish new DNS records saying what IP address my website should point towards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every computer in a home network talks to the internet using the home router. 
The home router has an external, or public-facing, IP address used to access websites. 
This IP address can be changed by an ISP without warning. 
In order to utilize DNS, it’s important to know what your IP address is at all times and rely on the fact that it will not change over time. 
This is where DDNS comes into play.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I noticed that the WiFi would intermittently go down on a daily basis – of course there couldn’t possibly be a reason for this…</p>
<p>My best conclusion is that my ISP didn't like No-IP’s application having periodic traffic to confirm my home router's external IP address. Otherwise, it could have been a malicious actor or a bot was actually scanning my network/ports, or some other unforeseeable reason.</p>
<h2>choosing the tech stack</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A tech stack is a list of all the technology services used to run a single application or website.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I was using before I had to shutdown the website:</p>
<ol>
<li>“On-premise” hardware: Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>Operating System: <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_OS" target="”_blank”">Raspberry Pi OS</a></em></strong>, based on <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian" target="”_blank”">Debian</a></em></strong> (a <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="”_blank”">Linux</a></em></strong> distribution)</li>
<li>Web Server: <strong><em><a href="https://nginx.org/en/" target="”_blank”">nginx</a></em></strong></li>
<li>Content Type: some good ol’ HTML and CSS<sup id="fnref2:basic website"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:basic website">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<h3>to <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="”_blank”">cloud</a></em></strong> or to self-host, that is the question</h3>
<p>After much deliberation and moral indignation at the choices that led me here, I unwillingly chose to switch to using the cloud<sup id="fnref:cloud meme"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:cloud meme">3</a></sup>. 
Instead of being cool and hosting a website on a goddamn Raspberry Pi, I'm now hosting the website in <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform" target="”_blank”">GCP</a></em></strong> (the Google Cloud Platform). 
I was really proud of myself for getting hardware I could touch and feel to host a website readily accessible from the Internet. 
But, in order to mitigate the ISP issues from occurring, I had no choice but to host the website remotely. 
It’s not like I have another network laying around so the next best thing is to use the cloud. </p>
<h3>the software’s hardware</h3>
<p>I left a lot of the hardware set up details out in my previous blog post simply because I felt like it would be a blog post of its own. 
Setting up the Raspberry Pi, to put it succinctly, involved putting some of the hardware together, downloading the appropriate 
<strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_image" target="_blank">image</a></em></strong>, and then 
<strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardening_(computing)" target="”_blank”">hardening</a></em></strong> the OS, operating system. 
I must admit, creating <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine" target="”_blank”">VMs</a></em></strong>, (virtual machines) in the cloud is much easier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A VM is a software-defined computer existing only in code. 
Most likely the machine, or computer, that you and I are using everyday is physically, or hardware-, defined.
A VM, much like a hardware-defined machine, has a CPU, RAM, storage, and can even connect to the internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the GCP console, I created a project to hold all of my resources related to running this website, attached a billing account (gave my credit card info yippee), specified my hardware/network requirements for the VM, and then created it with a simple tap of a button. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The VM, itself, is an "e2 standard" instance which means it uses <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadwell_(microarchitecture)" target="”_blank”">Intel Core Broadwell processors</a></em></strong>. 
The VM’s hardware specs include two <strong><em><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/virtual-CPU-vCPU" target="”_blank”">vCPUs</a></em></strong> ( virtual CPUs), 16 GB of RAM, and 128<sup id="fnref:storage overkill"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:storage overkill">4</a></sup> GB of storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>the OS</h3>
<p>The old tech stack used RPO, Raspberry Pi OS. 
RPO, if you couldn’t tell from the name, was made for the Raspberry Pi because it needed something more suitable for a single-board computer. 
Asides from that, I wanted to familiarize myself with a Linux flavor I hadn’t used before.</p>
<p>On the flip side, working in the cloud gives me flexibility on what OS I can choose to use. 
I’m pretty familiar with using <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu" target="”_blank”">Ubuntu</a></em></strong>, a Linux distribution, from messing around with VMs on my personal machine and class assignments.
I wanted to quickly get the website back and running, so I just went with what I was most familiar with!</p>
<h3>the web restaurant</h3>
<p>I chose nginx as my web server because it is known to outperform other popular web servers in benchmark tests, especially when it comes to serving static content. 
All it takes is making some changes in the nginx-specific config file for my
nginx is an incredibly useful tool that removes the need to create an HTTP web server from scratch<sup id="fnref:future project"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:future project">5</a></sup>. 
I generated using <strong><em><a href="https://getpelican.com/#quickstart" target="”_blank”">Pelican</a></em></strong>, a static site generator.</p>
<h3>the arcane magic of DNS, or how did i set up my URL</h3>
<p>With my new set-up, I didn’t have to worry about DDNS because there was no Internet traffic going through my home router. 
In the GCP console, I configured my external IP address to be static. 
Then, I obtained a lease to the domain <code>aadith-thiruvallarai.com</code> from <strong><em><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="”_blank”">Squarespace</a></em></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can’t actually own a URL. 
You can only lease it from companies like GoDaddy and Squarespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Configuring DNS involves creating and publishing what is known as DNS records.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“DNS records are sets of instructions that live on DNS servers. 
These instructions are vital to the success of a DNS lookup.” 
- Cloudflare</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DNS records come in many flavors but the only one I had to be concerned with was an A record.
An A record points the URL to the website’s server’s IP address.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/blog/2025/april/the-blog-went-down-oh-no/custom-records.png" alt="Squarespace Custom Records" width="600">
  <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Squarespace Custom Records</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In Squarespace, I created an A record with the hostname (data field) set as <code>@</code>, shorthand for the domain <code>aadith-thiruvallarai.com</code>, pointing to my VM’s public IP address.</p>
<h3>the final choices</h3>
<p>So, here’s the new and improved stack:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cloud Infrastructure: GCP</li>
<li>Operating System: Ubuntu</li>
<li>Web Server: nginx</li>
<li>Content type: some good ol’ HTML/CSS<sup id="fnref:basic website"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:basic website">2</a></sup></li>
